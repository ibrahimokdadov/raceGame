# 3D Car Racing Game Development Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to rebuild and enhance the 3D car racing game.

## Current Progress

- [x] **Step 1: Basic Three.js Setup (Rotating Cube)**
    - [x] Set up `index.html` and `style.css`.
    - [x] Implement a minimal `script.js` to display a rotating green cube.
    - [x] **Verification:** Confirmed rotating cube is visible.
- [ ] **Step 2: Integrate GLTFLoader and Load Car Model** (Postponed)
    - [ ] Modify `script.js` to load `car_model.gltf` instead of the cube.
    - [ ] **Verification:** Confirm car model is visible.
- [x] **Step 3: Re-introduce Road and Basic Movement**
    - [x] Add road and basic car/road movement logic to `script.js`.
    - [x] **Verification:** Confirmed car on moving road, basic controls work.
- [x] **Step 4: Add UI Elements and Game State**
    - [x] Re-add UI elements to `index.html` and `style.css`.
    - [x] Connect UI to game state in `script.js`.
    - [x] **Verification:** Confirmed UI is visible and updating.
- [x] **Step 5: Implement Obstacles and Coins**
    - [x] Add obstacle/coin generation and collision logic to `script.js`.
    - [x] **Verification:** Confirmed obstacles/coins appear and collisions work.
- [x] **Step 6: Refine Visuals (Skybox, Fog, Textures)**
    - [x] Add skybox, fog, and lighting.
    - [x] Make road dark gray with white stripes.
    - [x] Implement dynamic obstacle spawning (increasing density with progress, capped).
    - [x] Recreated `steering_wheel.svg` and positioned it lower.
    - [ ] Add light poles.
    - [ ] **Verification:** Confirm visual improvements.
